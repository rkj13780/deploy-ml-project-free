The current probleme is where can we deploy a ML project free, earlier Heroku was providing the platform but not now.
  So we will user render.com for this and will work to deploy a simple project.

Step 1: Train a ML Model -> export pickle file (you can get the pickl file after running the notebook from here https://github.com/rkj13780/student-placement-prediction)
Step 2: Create folder name render-demo,  cd render-demo, create vertual env -> ($python -m venv myenv)-> activate myenv ($myenv\Scripts\activate)
  2.1 create a file .gitignore file and and myenv
  2.2 paste the PKL file which has been optain from Step1.

Step 3: Create Flask app file (app.py)
  3.1 Create templates folder
  3.2 crate index.html file under template folder and paste the code over there from repo.

Step 4: install the libraries locally (pip install -r requirements.txt) (to unstalll use this command $pip freeze > uninstall.txt -> $pip uninstall -r uninstall.txt -y)
  4.1 $pip install flask numpy==1.25.2 pandas==2.0.3 scikit-learn==1.2.2 gunicorn
  pip install flask numpy==1.26.4 pandas==2.2.2 scikit-learn==1.5.2 gunicorn

step 5: run locally

step 6: create github repo -> push the code

step 7: Deploy on Render.com
